Credit Card Transactions ETL & EDA Pipeline (PySpark)
This project demonstrates a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) pipeline for a semi-structured credit card fraud dataset using PySpark. The pipeline covers:

JSON flattening (multi-level fields)

PII masking (credit card numbers, date of birth)

Timestamp parsing and cleaning (standardizes and drops bad values)

Dirty data handling (flags and removes problematic records)

Sample data visualizations (using Pandas/Matplotlib)

Exports cleaned data to Excel for further use
